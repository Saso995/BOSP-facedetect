# BOSP-facedetect

This repo contains the src code of a porting of a OpenCV sample to the Adaptive Execution Model used by the framework Barbeque Run-Time Resource Manager (BarbequeRTRM) [a link](https://bosp.deib.polimi.it/doku.php?id=start)

1)To can build the application it is necessary to have OpenCV library installed on the machine.<br/>
2)The default path used is ~/BOSP<br/>
3)Once the application is built just run it in the bosp shell using the command "facedetect", or "facedect -h" for help<br/>
