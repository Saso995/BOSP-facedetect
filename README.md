# BOSP-facedetect

This repo contains the src code of a porting of the OpenCV sample, facedetect.cpp, (available at this [link](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d4/d26/samples_2cpp_2facedetect_8cpp-example.html)) to the Adaptive Execution Model used by the framework Barbeque Run-Time Resource Manager (BarbequeRTRM) (more info [here](https://bosp.deib.polimi.it/doku.php?id=start))<br/>


1)To can build the application it is necessary to have OpenCV library installed on the machine.<br/>
2)The default path used is ~/BOSP<br/>
3)Once the application is built just run it in the bosp shell using the command "facedetect", or "facedect -h" for help<br/>
